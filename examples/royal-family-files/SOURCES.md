## Photo usage note

Portraits are downloaded from public Wikipedia/Wikimedia sources and stored as sibling files next to each person markdown file (for example `King George VI.jpg` beside `King George VI.md`).

If no publicly available image is found for a person, no image file is stored and the UI renders initials in the avatar circle.
